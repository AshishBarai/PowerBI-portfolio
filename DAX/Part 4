10. Using SELECTEDVALUE()

Returns the value when the context for columnName has been filtered 
down to one distinct value only. Otherwise returns alternateResult.

Syntax:
SELECTEDVALUE(<columnName>[, <alternateResult>])

SelectedCity_Measure = CALCULATE([Total quantity], Customers[customer_city] = SELECTEDVALUE(Customers[customer_city], "Arcadia"))

Explanation:
> CALCULATE function: Changes the context in which the data is evaluated.
> [Total quantity]: This refers to a previously defined measure, such as 
 SUM(sales[quantity]).
> Customers[customer_city] = SELECTEDVALUE(Customers[customer_city], "Arcadia"): This 
 applies a filter where the customer_city is equal to the selected value from the 
 Customers[customer_city] column. If no value is selected, it defaults to "Arcadia".

Effectiveness:
> The SELECTEDVALUE function allows for dynamic filtering based on user interaction with 
 the report, making it highly effective for interactive reports.
> Defaulting to "Arcadia" ensures that the measure still produces a result even if no 
 specific city is selected, providing robustness to the measure.
