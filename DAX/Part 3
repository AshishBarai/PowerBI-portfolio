7. Using COUNTROWS() function:

The COUNTROWS function counts the number of rows in the specified table,
or in a table defined by an expression.

Syntax:
COUNTROWS([<table>])

COUNTROWS_measures = COUNTROWS(Sales)

Explanation:
> COUNTROWS function: This function counts the number of rows in the specified 
 table.
> sales: This specifies the table from which the rows will be counted.

Effectiveness:
> The COUNTROWS function is straightforward and efficient for counting the 
number of rows in a table.
> It is particularly useful when you want to know the total number of transactions, 
records, or any other row-level data in a table.


8. Using COUNT() Functions:

Counts the number of rows in the specified column that contain non-blank values.

Syntax:
COUNT([column])

COUNT_Measure = COUNT(Sales[Trasaction_table])

Explantion:
> COUNT function: This function counts the number of non-blank values in a specified 
column.
> Sales[Transaction_table]: This specifies the column within the Sales table where the 
non-blank values will be counted.

Effectiveness:
> The COUNT function is useful when you want to count the number of entries in a 
column, excluding any blank or null values.
> It is particularly effective for counting occurrences of specific data points, such 
as the number of transactions recorded in the Transaction_table column.


9. Using COUNTX() function:
The COUNTAX function counts non-blank results when evaluating the result of an expression 
over a table. That is, it works just like the COUNTA function, but is used to iterate through 
the rows in a table and count rows where the specified expressions results in a non-blank result.

Syntax:
COOUNTX([<table>],[<Exprestion>])

COUNTX_measure = COUNTX(Sales,[Total Quantity])

Explanation:
> COUNTX function: This is an iterator function that evaluates an expression for each 
row of a table and counts the number of non-blank results.
> Sales: This specifies the table over which the expression is evaluated.
> [Total Quantity]: This refers to a previously defined measure or column in the Sales 
table that contains the quantity to be counted.

Effectiveness:
> The COUNTX function is useful for counting non-blank results of an expression evaluated 
for each row in a table.
> It provides more flexibility than the COUNT function as it allows for complex expressions 
to be evaluated row-by-row.
