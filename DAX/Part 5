13. using RELATED() function:

Returns the related values from ANOTHER table.
also the relation between the dimension to fact table should be ONE to MANY

Syntax:
RELATED(<column>)

product_cost = RELATED('d-Products'[ProductCost])

Explanation:
> RELATED function: This function retrieves a related value from another 
 table based on an existing relationship in the data model.
> 'd-Products': The table from which the related value is retrieved.
> [ProductCost]: The column in the 'd-Products' table whose values are retrieved.

Effectiveness:
> The RELATED function is effective for bringing in values from related tables without 
 needing to create complex joins or additional tables.
> It allows you to leverage relationships in the data model to enhance your calculations 
 and enrich your dataset with related data.

14. Using REALTEDTABLE:

Evaluates a table expression in a context modified by the given filters.
Also relationship between them fact to dimension should be many to one realtionship 

Syntax:
RELATEDTABLE(<tableName>)

Order qty = SUMX(RELATEDTABLE('f-sales'),[total order quantity])

Explanation:
> SUMX function: This is an iterator function that iterates over a table, evaluating an 
 expression for each row and then summing the results.
> RELATEDTABLE function: This function retrieves a related table based on the existing 
 relationships in the data model. In this context, it returns all rows from the 'f-sales' 
 table that are related to the current row context.
> [total order quantity]: This refers to a previously defined measure or column that calculates
 the total order quantity.

Effectiveness:
> The SUMX function combined with RELATEDTABLE is powerful for performing row-by-row 
 calculations on related tables and aggregating the results.
> It leverages relationships in your data model to dynamically fetch related rows and 
 perform calculations on them.
