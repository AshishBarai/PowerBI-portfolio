4. Using ALL() Function:

Returns all the rows in a table, or all the values in a column, ignoring 
any filters that might have been applied. This function is useful for clearing 
filters and creating calculations on all the rows in a table.

Syntax:
ALL( [<table> | <column>[, <column>[, <column>[,…]]]] )

ALL_measures = CALCULATE([Total quantity], ALL(Customers))

Explanation:
> CALCULATE function: Changes the context in which the data is evaluated.
> [Total quantity]: This refers to a previously defined measure, such as 
 SUM(sales[quantity]).
> ALL(Customers): This removes any filters that have been applied to the 
 Customers table.

5. Using ALLSELECTED() Function

Removes context filters from columns and rows in the current query, while retaining all 
other context filters or explicit filters

It returns all the rows and columns from the table ignoring all the filters if there is,
but keeps the filters that comes from outside.

or

It returns all the rows or columns ignoring all the filters that might me there inside 
the query and keeps the filters that are outside from the particular query

Syntax:
ALLSELECTED([<tableName> | <columnName>[, <columnName>[, <columnName>[,…]]]] )

ALLSELECTED_measures = CALCULATE([Total quantity], ALLSELECTED(Customers))

Effectiveness:
> The ALLSELECTED function is effective for scenarios where you want to retain 
 user-applied filters but remove intermediate filters.
> This is particularly useful for dynamic reports where the user's selections 
 should be honored, but the calculation should not be affected by other filters 
 within the same visual or context.


6. Using ALLEXCEPT() Function:

Removes all context filters in the table except filters that have been applied to the 
specified

Syntax:
ALLEXCEPT(<table>,<column>[,<column>[,…]])

ALLExcept_measures = CALCULATE([Total quantity], ALLExcept(Customers,Customers[customer_city]))

Explanation:
> CALCULATE function: Changes the context in which the data is evaluated.
> [Total quantity]: This refers to a previously defined measure, such as 
 SUM(sales[quantity]).
> ALLEXCEPT(Customers, Customers[customer_city]): This function removes all filters from
 the Customers table except those applied to the Customers[customer_city] column.
