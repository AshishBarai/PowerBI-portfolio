Q : How to calculate total sales or revenue with inactive relationship?

About inactive relationship:
In Power BI and other data modeling tools, you can have multiple relationships between tables, but only one can be active at a time. The others are considered inactive.

Active Relationship: The default relationship used for calculations and filtering.
Inactive Relationship: A relationship that exists but is not used by default. It can be activated temporarily using the USERELATIONSHIP function.

Revenue with inactive relationship = CALCULATE([Revenue],USERELATIONSHIP('d-Calendar'[Date],'f-sales'[StockDate]))

1. CALCULATE: This function evaluates an expression in a modified filter context. In this case, the expression is [Revenue].
2. USERELATIONSHIP: This function is used to specify which relationship to use in a calculation. It temporarily activates an inactive relationship between two columns for the duration of the calculation.
