There are two tables, first table contains country, continent and population, 
the sencond table contains yers with the values of 2020 and 2021, we need 
to merge or append the second table to first table and each counrty should 
have separate year values.

To do this we create new columns in both the table and file them with 
value 1, and then we use left join in the first table, this will ass the 
year in each values with year 2020 and 2021.
