What is the difference between filter and slicer 

Filters
Filters in Power Bi are used to refine data displayed in reports. They can be appled at different levels:
1. Visual Level Filters: These filters apply only to a specific visual on the report.
2. Page Level Filters: These filters apply to all visual on a specific page.
3. Report Level Filters: These filters apply to all visuals across all pages in the report.

Filters are typically located in the filter pane on the right side of the Power BI interface.
They can be hidden from end-user or locked to prevent changes. Filters are useful for developers to 
control the date view before sharing the report with end-users

Slicers
Silcers are visual elements that allow users to interactively filter data on the report canvas.
They are designed for easy end-users interaction and can be added directly to the report page. Silcers
can be in the form of lists, drop-downs, or checkboxes, providing immediate feedback on data changes.

Key Differences

1. Visibility:
> Filters: Typically operate in the background and can be hidden or locked.
> Slicers: Visible on the report canvas and designed for user interaction.

2. Interactivity:
> Filters: Applied through the Filters pane and are less interactive for end-users.
> Slicers: Allow users to dynamically filter data directly on the report page.

3. Usage:
> Filters: Ideal for developers to control data views before sharing reports.
> Slicers: Best for end-users to explore and interact with data in real-time.

4. Customization:
> Filters: Can be applied at visual, page, or report levels.
> Slicers: Can be synchronized across multiple pages for consistent filtering.

When to Use Each
> Use Filters when you need to control the data view without user interaction or when you want to apply filters at different levels (visual, page, report).
> Use Slicers when you want to provide an interactive and user-friendly way for end-users to filter data directly on the report canvas.
