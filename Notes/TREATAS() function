ðŸš€ Using the TREATAS() Function to Connect Unrelated Tables in DAX ðŸ’¡

When working with data models in Power BI, there are situations where two tables, such as a calendar_table and a sales_table, may not be connected directly through a relationship. In such cases, how can we establish a connection?

The solution is the TREATAS() function! ðŸ› ï¸

What is the TREATAS() function?
The TREATAS() function allows us to treat the columns of one table as if they were columns from another, effectively applying filters between unrelated tables.

How does it work?
It takes the result of a table expression and applies it as a filter to columns from an unrelated table. For each column, TREATAS() filters out any values that are not present in the respective output column.

Syntax: TREATAS(table_expression, <column>[,<column>[,<column>[,...]]])

Example:
Letâ€™s say you want to calculate total sales based on the number of years present in the calendar_table, but thereâ€™s no direct relationship between the calendar_table and the sales_table. You can use the TREATAS() function like this:

DAX
Revenue Amount = 
CALCULATE(SUM('sales_table'[Revenue]), 
TREATAS(VALUES('calendar_table'[Year]), 'sales_table'[Year]))

In this example:

> The TREATAS() function is filtering the sales_table based on the Year column from the calendar_table.
> It applies the values of Year from the calendar as a filter on the Year column in the sales data, even though the two tables arenâ€™t related directly.
