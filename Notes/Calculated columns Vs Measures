Q: What is the difference between Measures and calculated columns?

Measures:
> Do not consume physical storage space.
> Calculated dynamically (on the fly) during queries or visualizations.
> Cannot create or participate in relationships.
> Context-sensitive: Measures are evaluated based on the context (filters, slicers, etc.), which allows them to return different results depending on the current view.
> Optimized for performance: Since they are calculated only when needed, they tend to perform better, especially with large datasets.
> DAX expressions: Measures are typically written using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and they aggregate data, like sums, averages, or custom calculations.

Calculated Columns:
> Occupy storage space, which can lead to slower loading times.
> Calculated row by row and stored in the model.
> Can create and participate in relationships within the data model.
> Static calculation: Once calculated, the values in a calculated column are stored in the data model and do not change unless the data model is refreshed.
> Useful for row-level calculations: Ideal for creating new fields based on row-by-row calculations, such as combining two text columns or categorizing values.
> Less efficient with large datasets: Because calculated columns are stored, they can slow down performance when dealing with massive datasets.
