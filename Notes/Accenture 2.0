üîß Debugging and Optimizing DAX Code üõ†Ô∏è

1Ô∏è‚É£ Original Code:
Measure1 = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Sales), [Total Sales] > 500)
Issue: The CALCULATE function allows us to modify the context of a calculation, but in the filter argument, you cannot directly reference a measure like [Total Sales]. To fix this, we need to include the FILTER function, which provides row context to check the condition for each row.

‚úÖ Corrected Code:
Measure = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Sales), FILTER(Sales,[Total Sales] > 500))
Explanation: The FILTER function works by iterating over each row in the Sales table and applying the condition [Total Sales] > 500 for those rows. This ensures that the CALCULATE function filters only those rows where total sales exceed 500, making the logic valid.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Original Code:
Measure2 = IF(HASONEVALUE(Sales[Country]), VALUES(Sales[Country]))
Optimization: While this code works, it can be simplified and optimized using SELECTEDVALUE. SELECTEDVALUE automatically returns the single value when only one exists, so there's no need for IF and HASONEVALUE.

‚úÖ Optimized Code:
Measure2 = SELECTEDVALUE(Sales[Country])
Explanation: SELECTEDVALUE simplifies the logic by checking if there's only one value in Sales[Country]. It returns that value if found or BLANK() if there are multiple values. This makes the code cleaner and more efficient.
