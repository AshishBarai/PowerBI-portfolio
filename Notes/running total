how to calculate running total

# Running Total
> Definition: A running total, also known as a cumulative total, is the sum of a sequence of numbers which is updated each time a new number is added to the sequence.
> Calculation: It starts from the first date and accumulates values over time. For example, if we are calculating the running total of sales, you keep adding each dayâ€™s sales to the previous total.
> Use Case: Useful for understanding the total growth or accumulation over a period. For instance, tracking total sales from the beginning of the year to the current date.

Dax for running total:
running total = CALCULATE([Revenue],FILTER(ALL('d-Calendar'),'d-Calendar'[Date] <= MAX('d-Calendar'[Date])))
