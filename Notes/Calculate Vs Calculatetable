What is the difference between Calculate and Calculatetable ?

Both CALCULATE and CALCULATETABLE are powerful DAX functions in Power BI, but they serve different purposes:

1. CALCULATE:
> Purpose: Modifies the filter context of an expression and returns a single scalar value.
> Example: Profit by Bikes = CALCULATE([Profit], 'd-Categories'[CategoryName] = "Bikes")
> Usage: Typically used to create measures that return a single value based on the modified filter context.

2. CALCULATETABLE:
> Purpose: Modifies the filter context of a table expression and returns a table.
> Example: Profit by CalculateTable = SUMX(CALCULATETABLE('d-Categories', 'd-Categories'[CategoryName] = "Bikes"), [Profit])
> Usage: Used when you need to return a table that can be further processed, such as in a SUMX function to iterate over the rows of the table.

In our examples:

The CALCULATE function is used to calculate the total profit for the “Bikes” category by modifying the filter context to include only rows where CategoryName is “Bikes”.
The CALCULATETABLE function is used to create a table that includes only rows where CategoryName is “Bikes”, and then SUMX iterates over this table to sum the Profit values.
