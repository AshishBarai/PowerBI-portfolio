Q : How to calculate last 7 days of sales?

Last 7 days sales = CALCULATE([Revenue],DATESINPERIOD('d-Calendar'[Date],MAX('d-Calendar'[Date]),-7,DAY))

1. CALCULATE([Revenue], …):
> The CALCULATE function modifies the context in which the data is evaluated. Here, it calculates the [Revenue] measure within a specific context defined by the DATESINPERIOD function.

2. DATESINPERIOD(‘d-Calendar’[Date], MAX(‘d-Calendar’[Date]), -7, DAY):
> The DATESINPERIOD function returns a table that contains a column of dates shifted by a specified interval.
> 'd-Calendar'[Date] is the column containing the dates.
> MAX('d-Calendar'[Date]) finds the latest date in the ‘d-Calendar’ table.
> -7 specifies the interval to go back 7 days from the latest date.
> DAY specifies the granularity of the interval (in this case, days).
